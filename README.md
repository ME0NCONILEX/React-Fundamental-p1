# To begin with some simple React drills...
(I really hope that you know how to proceed when you change from a drill to another one.)

## In this project, you can run:
 * 0 (App.js)-App >> Menu (a simple fanny example)
 * 1 my1drill-clas  >> an simple introduction
 * 2 my2drill-function  >> AppFunction
 * 3 my3drill-arrow-function  >> AppArrowFunction
 * 4 my4drill-table  >> Table (simple)
 * 5 my5drill-css  >> CSS (Style example)
 * 6 my6drill-var-function  >> Name List
 * 7 my7drill-props  >> Menu List
 * 8 my8drill-axios  >> Axios (fanny example + new edit)
 * 9 my9drill-router  >> Router
 * 10 my10drill-structure  >> Structure
 * 11a my11adrill-counterevent  >> Counter
 * 11b my11bdrill-textevent  >> Text changing (example)
 * 12 my12drill-date  >> Date & Time
 * 13 my13drill-memo  >> Memo (simple experiment)
